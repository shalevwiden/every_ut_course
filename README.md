# Every Single Course at UT Austin

All in an HTML table.
Currently unstyled. Without pagination and with styling, the table is extremely laggy and barely loads. 11,000+ rows of data. So there is no styling on this table.

See it deployed here:

### Theres also a .db file and a csv file in this repo.

This might be of use to any developers at UT. Or you can query the .db file with SQL and get a lot of stats and data just for fun.
